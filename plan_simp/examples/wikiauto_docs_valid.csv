was the Broad Street pump. <s> He persuaded the authorities to remove the handle of the pump, thus preventing any more of the infected water from being collected. <s> The spring below the pump was later found to have been contaminated with sewage. <s> This is an early example of epidemiology, public health medicine and the application of science—the germ theory of disease—in a real-life crisis.

Street (now Broadwick Street) and Cambridge Street (now Lexington Street), close to the rear wall of what is today the ""John Snow"" public house. <s> John Snow mapped the addresses of the sick, and noted that they were mostly people whose nearest access to water was the Broad Street pump. <s> He persuaded the authorities to remove the handle of the pump, thus preventing any more of the infected water from being collected. <s> The spring below the pump was later found to have been contaminated with sewage. <s> This is an early example of epidemiology, public health medicine and the

as being ""given or taking up the mop"", a term which has also been used elsewhere. <s> In 2006, ""The New York Times"" reported that administrators on Wikipedia, of whom there were then about 1,000, were ""geographically diverse"". <s> In July 2012, it was widely reported that Wikipedia was ""running out of administrators"", because in 2005 and 2006, 40 to 50 people were often appointed

running out of admins, saying, ""The number of admins has been stable for about two years, there's really nothing going on."" <s> Wales had previously (in a message sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003) stated that being an admin is ""not a big deal"", and that ""It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone."" <s> In

Wikipedia are now granted through a process known as requests for adminship (RfA). <s> Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. <s> The process has been said to be ""akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court"" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. <s> Lih also said, ""It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point"", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was ""prove you weren't a bozo"". <s> Candidacy for the role is normally considered only after ""extensive work on the wiki"". <s> While any editor may vote in an RfA, the outcome is not determined by a majority vote, but rather by whether or not consensus has been reached that the candidate would make a good administrator, a decision which can only be made by a bureaucrat, a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a ""request"" process, though the process is much stricter for them than for administrators. <s> This may have been implemented as a result of RfAs attracting increasing levels of attention: Stvilia et

Simple English Wikipedia. <s> Administrators have special rights that other editors do not have. <s> On Wikipedia, becoming an admin is often referred to as being ""given or taking up the mop"", a term which has also been used elsewhere. <s> In 2006,there were about 1,000 administrators on the English Wikipedia. <s> In July 2012, it was reported that Wikipedia was ""running out of administrators"". <s> This was because in 2006-2007 an average of 40-50 new administrators were appointed. <s> In the first six months of 2012 only 9 new administrators were appointed. <s> But the co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, did not believe that this was a crisis. <s> He also did not believe Wikipedia was running out of admins. <s> Wales said earlier that being an admin is ""not a big deal”. <s> He also said that ""It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.” <s> He said this in a message he sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003. <s> In his book ""Wikipedia – The Missing Manual"", John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role. <s> Instead, he says, admins usually ""delete pages"" and ""protect pages involved in edit wars"". <s> The first Wikipedia administrators were appointed by Jimmy Wales himself in October 2001. <s> Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. <s> The process has been said to be ""akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court"" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. <s> Lih also said, ""It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point"", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was ""prove you weren't a bozo"" Editors can become candidates only after ""extensive work on the wiki"". <s> Any editor can vote in an RfA. <s> The decision if a consensus has been reached can only be made by a bureaucrat. <s> A bureaucrat is a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a ""request"" process which is much stricter for them than for administrators. <s> This RFA process was started after RfAs attracted a lot of attention. <s> Before the middle of 2005, RfAs did not attract a lot of attention. <s> But then RfAs started attracting groups of editors who all supported one another. <s> When an admin blocks a user they must do so according to Wikipedia's policies. <s> One of the policies is that a reason must be given for the block. <s> The reason for the block is permanently logged by the software. <s> A scientific paper by researchers from Virginia Tech and Rensselaer

Polymorphism (biology),23763,"In biology and zoology, polymorphism is the occurrence of two or more clearly different morphs or forms, also referred to as alternative ""phenotypes"", in the population of a species. <s> To be classified as such, morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a panmictic population (one with random mating). <s> Put simply, polymorphism is when there are two or more possibilities of a trait on a gene. <s> For example, there is more than one possible trait in terms of a jaguar's skin colouring; they can have light-morph or dark-morph colouring. <s> Due to having more than one possible variation for this gene, it is termed 'polymorphism'. <s> However, if the jaguar has only one possible trait for that gene, it would be termed ""monomorphic"". <s> For example, if there was only one possible skin colour that a jaguar could have, it would be termed monomorphic. <s> Polymorphism is common in nature; it is related to biodiversity, genetic variation, and adaptation. <s> Polymorphism usually functions to retain variety of form in a population living in a varied environment. <s> The most common example is sexual dimorphism, which occurs in many organisms. <s> Other examples are mimetic forms of butterflies (see mimicry), and human hemoglobin and blood types. <s> The definition has three parts: a) sympatry: one interbreeding population; b) discrete forms; and c) not maintained just by mutation. <s> Genetic polymorphism is actively and steadily maintained in populations by natural selection, in contrast to ""transient polymorphisms"" where a form is progressively replaced by another. <s> By definition, genetic polymorphism relates to a balance or equilibrium between morphs. <s> The mechanisms that conserve it are types of balancing selection. <s> The mechanism which decides which of several morphs an individual displays is called the ""switch"". <s> This switch may be genetic, or it may be environmental. <s> Taking sex determination as the example, in humans the determination is genetic, by the XY sex-determination system. <s> In Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), sex determination is by haplo-diploidy: the females are all diploid, the males are haploid. <s> However, in some animals an environmental trigger determines the sex: alligators are a famous case in point. <s> In ants the distinction between workers and guards is environmental, by the feeding of the grubs. <s> Polymorphism with an environmental trigger is called polyphenism. <s> The polyphenic system does have a degree of environmental flexibility not present in the genetic polymorphism. <s> However, such environmental triggers are the less common of the two methods. <s> Sickle-cell anaemia is found mostly in tropical populations in Africa and India. <s> An individual homozygous for the recessive sickle hemoglobin, HgbS, has a short expectancy of life, whereas the life expectancy of the standard hemoglobin (HgbA) homozygote and also the heterozygote is normal (though heterozygote individuals will suffer periodic problems). <s> The sickle-cell variant survives in the population because the heterozygote is resistant to malaria and the malarial parasite kills a huge number of people each year. <s> This is balancing selection or genetic polymorphism, balanced between fierce selection against homozygous sickle-cell sufferers, and selection against the standard HgbA homozygotes by malaria. <s> The heterozygote has a permanent advantage (a higher fitness) so long as malaria exists;

Sacred Heart College, Auckland, a Catholic boarding school. <s> In 1971 he started a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Auckland. <s> There he jammed in music practice room 129 (later the name of a Split Enz song) with friends and future Split Enz bandmembers Mike Chunn, Robert Gillies, Philip Judd and Noel Crombie. <s> Music soon became more important to him than his studies. <s> In 1972 he quit university. <s> A few months later, Phil and Tim formed the group Split Ends, renamed Split Enz in 1975, shortly before they left New Zealand for Melbourne. <s> Their music moved towards a more mainstream sound in later years, with an eclecticism that incorporated influences from art rock, vaudeville, swing, punk, glam rock, rock and pop. <s> Between 1972 and 1977, Tim and Judd alternated as frontman for the band. <s> When Judd left the band, Tim Finn's younger brother Neil Finn took his place. <s> Finn had his first success away from Split Enz in 1981 when his discarded demo ""They Won't Let My Girlfriend Talk to Me"" became a top 10 hit for Australian band Jimmy and the Boys. <s> In 1983 Finn recorded his debut solo album, ""Escapade"", while still a member of Split Enz. <s> This met with major commercial success both in Australia and New Zealand, and yielded hit song ""Fraction Too Much Friction"", which revealed a more rhythm-based sound than Split Enz had been known for. <s> After contributing four songs to Split Enz album ""Conflicting Emotions"", Finn left the band permanently in June 1984, to focus on a solo career. <s> The following year he moved to London. <s> 1986 saw the release of his second solo album ""Big Canoe"". <s> The album utilised a wide variety of instrumentation, including guitars, orchestral backings and traditional Indian instruments - most notably on single ""No Thunder, No Fire, No Rain"", which was inspired by the Bhopal chemical disaster. <s> Though ""Big Canoe"" reached number three on the New Zealand charts, it failed to become the international breakthrough that Finn or record company Virgin had hoped. <s> During this time, Finn's focus also turned to soundtrack music, and he landed a few acting roles on-screen. <s> Finn has composed for a number of Australian films and TV productions, including 1981 teen tale ""Puberty Blues"" and comedy ""Les Patterson Saves the World"", which yielded Australian hit ""You Saved the World"". <s> Finn had a small part in Australian film ""The Coca-Cola Kid"" alongside then-girlfriend Greta Scacchi, and a larger one in her Italian-shot romance ""La Donna della

and as the king declined to purchase them, owing to the exorbitant price she demanded, she burned three and offered the remaining six to Tarquinius at the same stiff price, which he again refused, whereupon she burned three more and repeated her offer. <s> Tarquinius then relented and purchased the last three at the full original price and had them preserved in a vault beneath the Capitoline temple of Jupiter. <s> The story is alluded to in Varro's lost books quoted in Lactantius ""Institutiones Divinae"" (I: 6) and by Origen, and told by Aulus Gellius (""Noctes Atticae"" 1, 19). <s> The Roman Senate kept tight control over the Sibylline Books;

the specific mechanism is yet unknown, but special cells with large vacuoles probably play an important role. <s> Similarly, some nudibranchs can also take in plant cells (symbiotic algae from soft corals) and reuse these to make food for themselves. <s> The related group of sacoglossan sea slugs feed on algae and retain just the chloroplasts for their own photosynthetic use, a process known as kleptoplasty. <s> Another method of protection is the release of an acid from the skin. <s> Once the specimen is physically irritated or touched by another creature, it will release the mucus automatically. <s> Nudibranchs are hermaphroditic, thus have a set of reproductive organs for both sexes, but they cannot fertilize themselves. <s> Mating usually takes a few minutes, and involves a dance-like courtship. <s> Nudibranchs typically deposit their eggs within a gelatinous spiral, which is often described as looking like a ribbon. <s> The number of eggs varies; it can be as few as just 1 or 2 eggs (""Vayssierea felis"") or as many as an estimated 25 million (""Aplysia fasciata""). <s> The eggs contain toxins from sea sponges as a means of deterring predators. <s> After hatching, the infants look almost identical to their adult counterparts, albeit smaller. <s> Infants may also have fewer cerata. <s> The lifespan of nudibranchs can range from a few weeks to a year, depending on the species. <s> All known nudibranchs are carnivorous. <s> Some feed on sponges, others on hydroids (e.g. ""Cuthona""), others on bryozoans (phanerobranchs such as ""Tambja"", ""Limacia, Plocamopherus"" and ""Triopha""), and some eat other sea slugs or their eggs (e.g. ""Favorinus"") or, on some occasions, are cannibals and prey on members of their own species. <s> Other groups feed on tunicates (e.g. ""Nembrotha"", ""Goniodoris""), other nudibranchs (""Roboastra"", which are descended from tunicate-feeding species), barnacles (e.g. ""Onchidoris bilamellata""), and anemones (e.g. the Aeolidiidae and other Cladobranchia). <s> The surface-dwelling nudibranch, ""Glaucus atlanticus"", is a specialist predator of siphonophores, such as the Portuguese man o' war. <s> This predatory mollusc sucks air into its stomach to keep it afloat, and using its muscular foot, it clings to the surface film. <s> If it finds a small victim, ""Glaucus"" simply envelops it with its capacious mouth, but if the prey is a larger siphonophore, the mollusc nibbles off its fishing tentacles, the ones carrying the most potent nematocysts. <s> Like some others of its kind, ""Glaucus"" does not digest the nematocysts; instead, it uses them to defend itself by passing them from its gut to the surface of its skin. <s> However, according to the taxonomy by Bouchet & Rocroi (2005), currently the most up-to-date system of classifying the gastropods, the Nudibranchia are a subclade within the clade of the Nudipleura.","Nudibranchs are a widespread and successful group of marine Gastropod molluscs. <s> They are ""opisthobranchs"", a clade which shed their shells after the larval stage. <s> The name means 'naked gills'. <s> Nudibranchs are one of the groups which are informally known as sea slugs. <s> The body forms of nudibranchs vary greatly. <s> Unlike most other gastropods they are ""bilaterally symmetrical"". <s> They have undergone secondary detorsion. <s> Unusually for molluscs, they lack a mantle cavity. <s> Most species have venomous appendages on their sides. <s> Many also have a simple gut and a mouth with a radula. <s> In the course of evolution, sea slugs have lost their shell, and have developed other defense mechanisms. <s> Their anatomy may resemble the texture and color of the surrounding plants, giving them camouflage (""crypsis""). <s> Nudibranchs that feed on hydroids can store the hydroids' nematocysts (stinging cells) in the dorsal body wall. <s> The nematocysts wander through the alimentary canal without harming the nudibranch. <s> Then, the cells are brought to specific places on the creature's hind body. <s> Nudibranches can protect themselves from the hydroids and their nematocysts. <s> It is not yet clear how, but special cells with large vacuoles probably play an important role. <s> They can also take in plants' chloroplasts (plant cell organelles used for photosynthesis) and use them to make food for themselves. <s> Another method of protection is the release of a sour liquid from the skin. <s> Once the specimen is physically irritated or touched by another creature, it will release the slime automatically. <s> Nudibranchs are hermaphrodite, and thus have a set of reproductive organs for both sexes, but they rarely fertilize themselves. <s> Most nudibranchs are carnivorous. <s> Some feed on sponges, others on polyps, others on bryozoans, and some eat other sea slugs, or, on some occasions, members of their own species. <s> Other groups feed on tunicates, barnacles, or anemones. <s> The surface dwelling nudibranch, ""Glaucus atlanticus"" is a specialist predator of jellyfish, such as the Portuguese Man o' War. <s> This predatory mollusc sucks air into its stomach to keep it afloat and using its muscular foot it clings to the surface film. <s> If it finds a small victim ""Glaucus"" simply envelops it with its large mouth, but if the prey is a larger siphonophore the mollusc nibbles off its fishing tentacles, the ones carrying the most potent nematocysts. <s> Like some others of its kind ""Glaucus"" does not digest the nematocysts;

Parasitoid wasp,85696,"Parasitoid wasps are a large group of hymenopteran superfamilies, with all but the wood wasps (Orussoidea) being in the wasp-waisted Apocrita. <s> As parasitoids, they lay their eggs on or in the bodies of other arthropods, sooner or later causing the death of these hosts. <s> Different species specialise in hosts from different insect orders, most often Lepidoptera, though some select beetles, flies, or bugs; the spider wasps (Pompilidae) exclusively attack spiders. <s> Many parasitoid wasps use larval Lepidoptera as hosts, but some groups parasitize different host life stages (egg, larva or nymph, pupa, adult) of nearly all other orders of insects, especially Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera and other Hymenoptera. <s> Some attack arthropods other than insects: for instance, the Pompilidae specialise in catching spiders: these are quick and dangerous prey, often as large as the wasp itself, but the spider wasp is quicker, swiftly stinging her prey to immobilise it. <s> Adult female wasps of most species oviposit into their hosts' bodies or eggs. <s> Some also inject a mix of secretory products that paralyse the host or protect the egg from the host's immune system; these include polydnaviruses, ovarian proteins, and venom. <s> If a polydnavirus is included, it infects the nuclei of host hemocytes and other cells, causing symptoms that benefit the parasite. <s> As adults, parasitoid wasps feed primarily on nectar from flowers. <s> Females of some species will also drink hemolymph from hosts to gain additional nutrients for egg production. <s> Polydnaviruses are a unique group of insect viruses that have a mutualistic relationship with some parasitic wasps. <s> The polydnavirus replicates in the oviducts of an adult female parasitoid wasp. <s> The wasp benefits from this relationship because the virus provides protection for the parasitic larvae inside the host, (i) by weakening the host's immune system and (ii) by altering the host's cells to be more beneficial to the parasite. <s> The relationship between these viruses and the wasp is obligatory in the sense that all individuals are infected with the viruses; the virus has been incorporated in the wasp's genome and is inherited. <s> The hosts of parasitoids have developed several levels of defence. <s> Many hosts try to hide from the parasitoids in inaccessible habitats. <s> They may also get rid of their frass (body wastes) and avoid plants that they have chewed on as both can signal their presence to parasitoids hunting for hosts. <s> The egg shells and cuticles of the potential hosts are thickened to prevent the parasitoid from penetrating them. <s> Hosts may use behavioral evasion when they encounter an egg laying female parasitoid, like dropping off the plant they are on, twisting and thrashing so as to dislodge or kill the female and even regurgitating onto the wasp to entangle it. <s> The wriggling can sometimes help by causing the wasp to ""miss"" laying the egg on the host and instead place it nearby. <s> Wriggling of pupae can cause the wasp to lose its grip on the smooth hard pupa or get trapped in the silk strands. <s> Some caterpillars even bite the female wasps that approach them. <s> Some insects secrete poisonous compounds that kill or drive away the parasitoid. <s> Ants that are in a symbiotic relationship with caterpillars, aphids or scale insects may protect them from attack by wasps. <s> Even parasitoid wasps are vulnerable to hyperparasitoid wasps. <s> Some parasitoid wasps change the behavior of the infected host, causing them to build a silk web around the pupae of the wasps after they emerge from its body to protect them from hyperparasitoids. <s> Hosts can kill endoparasitoids by adhering hemocytes to the egg or larva in a process called encapsulation. <s> In aphids, the presence of a secondary bacterium endosymbiont, ""Buchnera aphidicola"" that carries a particular latent phage makes the aphid relatively immune to their parasitoid wasps by killing many of the eggs. <s> As the parasitoid's survival depends on its ability to evade the host's immune response, some parasitoid wasps have developed the counterstrategy of laying more eggs in aphids that have the endosymbiont so that at least one of them may hatch and parasitize the aphid. <s> Certain caterpillars eat plants that are toxic to both themselves and the parasite to cure themselves. <s> ""Drosophila melanogaster"" larvae also ""self-medicate"" with ethanol to treat parasitism. <s> ""D. melanogaster"" females lay their eggs in food containing toxic amounts of alcohol if they detect parasitoid wasps nearby. <s> The alcohol protects them from the wasps, at the cost of retarding their own growth.","They are parasitoids which lay their eggs in or on the caterpillars of other insect species. <s> Many lay their eggs in inert stages of their host (egg or pupa). <s> Much like bees, butterflies, and moths, those which do feed as adults usually get all of their nutrition from nectar. <s> Polydnaviruses are a unique group of insect viruses that have a mutualistic relationship with parasitic wasps. <s> The polydnavirus, like all viruses, need a host to replicate itself. <s> This it does in the oviducts of the female wasp. <s> The virus protects the parasitic larva inside the host by weakening the host’s immune system. <s> The relationship between these viruses and the wasp is obligatory: all individuals are ‘infected’ with the viruses;

each eyeball is approximately 16 mm in diameter and is as large as, or in some cases larger than, its entire brain. <s> The unique cranial anatomy of the tarsier results from the need to balance their large eyes and heavy head so they are able to wait silently for nutritious prey. <s> Tarsiers have a strong auditory sense, and their auditory cortex is distinct. <s> Tarsiers also have long hind limbs, owing mostly to the elongated tarsus bones of the feet, from which the animals get their name. <s> The combination of their elongated tarsi and fused tibiofibulae makes them morphologically specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. <s> The head and body range from 10 to 15 cm in length, but the hind limbs are about twice this long (including the feet), and they also have a slender tail from 20 to 25 cm long. <s> Their fingers are also elongated, with the third finger being about the same length as the upper arm. <s> Most of the digits have nails, but the second and third toes of the hind feet bear claws instead, which are used for grooming. <s> Tarsiers have soft, velvety fur, which is generally buff, beige, or ochre in color. <s> Unlike many nocturnal vertebrates, tarsiers lack a light-reflecting layer (tapetum lucidum) of the retina and have a fovea. <s> The tarsier's brain is different from that of other primates in terms of the arrangement of the connections between the two eyes and the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is the main region of the thalamus that receives visual information. <s> The sequence of cellular layers receiving information from the ipsilateral (same side of the head) and contralateral (opposite side of the head) eyes in the lateral geniculate nucleus distinguishes tarsiers from lemurs, lorises, and monkeys, which are all similar in this respect. <s> Some neuroscientists suggested that ""this apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates, reinforcing the view that they arose in an early, independent line of primate evolution."" <s> Tarsiers are the only extant entirely carnivorous primates: they are primarily insectivorous, and catch insects by jumping at them. <s> They are also known to prey on birds, snakes, lizards, and bats. <s> Gestation takes about six months, and tarsiers give birth to single offspring. <s> Young tarsiers are born furred, and with open eyes, and are able to climb within a day of birth. <s> They reach sexual maturity by the end of their second year. <s> Sociality and mating system varies, with tarsiers from Sulawesi living in small family groups, while Philippine and western tarsiers are reported to sleep and forage alone. <s> Tarsiers tend to be extremely shy animals.","They were once widespread, but now tarsiers live only on islands in south-east Asia. <s> Fossils are found in Asia, Europe, and North America, and some disputed fossils from Africa. <s> The fossil record shows that their teeth have not changed much, except in size, in the past 45 million years. <s> They also have the longest continuous fossil record of any primate. <s> They have large eyes. <s> Each is about 16 mm wide.They are very sensitive to touch, and weigh as much as their entire brain. <s> Unlike many nocturnal animals, tarsiers lack a light-reflecting area (tapetum lucidum) of the eye. <s> They also have a fovea, which is also not usual in nocturnal animals. <s> The tarsier's brain is different from other primates in one respect. <s> The sequence of cell layers in the lateral geniculate nucleus getting information from both eyes is different from the set-up in lemurs, lorises, and monkeys. <s> ""This apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates, and reinforces the view that they arose in an early, independent line of primate evolution"". <s> Tarsiers are the only primates which are wholly carnivorous. <s> They mainly eat insects, but some are also known to eat birds and snakes. <s> Pregnancy takes about six months, which is a long time for such a small animal. <s> Tarsiers give birth to single offspring. <s> Tarsiers have incredibly good hearing.","['delete', 'rephrase', 'ssplit', 'rephrase', 'ssplit', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'ssplit', 'rephrase', 'rephrase', 'rephrase', 'rephrase', 'rephrase', 'ssplit', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'rephrase']",556,219,24,0.5

Second Party System,7570,"Historians and political scientists consider the Second Party System to be a term of periodization to designate the political party system operating in the United States from about 1828 to 1854, after the First Party System ended. <s> The system was characterized by rapidly rising levels of voter interest, beginning in 1828, as demonstrated by Election Day turnouts, rallies, partisan newspapers, and high degrees of personal loyalty to parties. <s> Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson, and the Whig Party, assembled by Henry Clay from the National Republicans and from other opponents of Jackson. <s> Minor parties included the Anti-Masonic Party, an important innovator from 1827 to 1834; the abolitionist Liberty Party in 1840; and the anti-slavery expansion Free Soil Party in 1848 and 1852. <s> The Second Party System reflected and shaped the political, social, economic and cultural currents of the Jacksonian Era, until succeeded by the Third Party System. <s> Historian Richard P. McCormick is most responsible for defining the term. <s> Among the best-known figures on the Democratic side were: Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John C. Calhoun, James K. Polk, Lewis Cass, and Stephen Douglas. <s> On the Whig side were John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, William H. Seward, and Thurlow Weed. <s> The 1824 presidential election operated without political parties and came down to a four-man race. <s> Each candidate (Henry Clay, William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and John Quincy Adams), all of whom were nominally Democratic Republicans, had a regional base of support involving factions in the various states. <s> With no electoral college majority, the choice devolved on the United States House of Representatives. <s> Clay was not among the three finalists, but as Speaker of the House he negotiated the settlement. <s> Jackson, despite having won the most popular votes and the most electoral votes, was not elected. <s> John Quincy Adams, son of former President John Adams, was elected, and he immediately chose Clay as Secretary of State. <s> Jackson loudly denounced this ""corrupt bargain."" <s> Campaigning vigorously he launched a crusade against the corruption he saw in Washington. <s> Appealing both to local militia companies (as the most famous of the nation's Indian fighters, and a hero of the War of 1812) and to state political factions, Jackson assembled a coalition, the embryonic Democratic Party, that ousted Adams in 1828. <s> Martin Van Buren, brilliant leader of New York politics, was Jackson's key aide, bringing along the large electoral votes of Virginia and Pennsylvania. <s> His reward was appointment as Secretary of State and later nomination and election to the vice presidency as heir to the Jacksonian tradition. <s> The Adams-Clay wing of the Democratic-Republican Party became known as the National Republicans, although Adams never considered himself a loyal member of the party. <s> Jackson considered himself a reformer, but he was committed to the old ideals of Republicanism, and bitterly opposed anything that smacked of special favors for special interests. <s> While Jackson never engaged in a duel as president, he had shot political opponents before and was just as determined to destroy his enemies on the battlefields of politics. <s> The Second Party System came about primarily because of Jackson's determination to destroy the Second Bank of the United States. <s> Headquartered in Philadelphia, with offices in major cities around the country, the federally chartered Bank operated somewhat like a central bank (like the Federal Reserve System a century later). <s> Local bankers and politicians annoyed by the controls exerted by Nicholas Biddle grumbled loudly. <s> Jackson did not like any banks (paper money was anathema to Jackson; he believed only gold and silver ""specie"" should circulate.) <s> After Herculean battles with Henry Clay, his chief antagonist, Jackson finally broke Biddle's bank. <s> Jackson continued to attack the banking system. <s> His ""Specie Circular"" of July 1836 rejected paper money issued by banks (it could no longer be used to buy federal land), insisting on gold and silver coins. <s> Most businessmen and bankers (but not all) went over to the Whig party, and the commercial and industrial cities became Whig strongholds. <s> Jackson meanwhile became even more popular with the subsistence farmers and day laborers who distrusted bankers and finance. <s> Jackson systematically used the federal patronage system, what was called the ""Spoils System"". <s> Jackson not only rewarded past supporters; he promised future jobs if local and state politicians joined his team. <s> As Syrett explains: When Jackson became President, he implemented the theory of rotation in office, declaring it ""a leading principle in the republican creed."" <s> He believed that rotation in office would prevent the development of a corrupt civil service. <s> On the other hand, Jackson's supporters wanted to use the civil service to reward party loyalists to make the party stronger. <s> In practice, this meant replacing civil servants with friends or party loyalists into those offices. <s> The spoils system did not originate with Jackson. <s> It originated under Thomas Jefferson when he removed Federalist office-holders after becoming president. <s> Also, Jackson did not out the entire civil service. <s> At the end of his term, Jackson had only dismissed less than twenty percent of the original civil service. <s> While Jackson did not start the spoils system, he did encourage its growth and it became a central feature of the Second Party System, as well as the Third Party System, until it ended in the 1890s. <s> As one historian explains: ""Although Jackson dismissed far fewer government employees than most of his contemporaries imagined and although he did not originate the spoils system, he made more sweeping changes in the Federal bureaucracy than had any of his predecessors.","It is a phrase used by historians and political scientists to describe the time period between 1828 and 1854. <s> People quickly became more interested in voting starting in 1828. <s> One was the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson. <s> The other was the Whig Party, started by Henry Clay. <s> The Whig party was made up of members of the National Republican Party and other people who opposed Jackson. <s> The Anti-Masonic Party (1827-34) was important in developing political ideas and laws. <s> The United States Free Soil Party in 1848 and 1852 was another anti-slavery party. <s> The Second Party System was an important part of the politics, society, economics, and culture of the Jacksonian Era. <s> The phrase ""second party system"" was defined by the historian Richard P.

Cry of Dolores,49565,"The Cry of Dolores is a historical event that occurred in Dolores (now Dolores Hidalgo), Mexico, in the early morning of 16 September 1810. <s> Roman Catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla rang the bell of his church and gave the ""pronunciamiento"" (call to arms) that triggered the Mexican War of Independence. <s> Gutiérrez de Lara went to Washington, D.C. for military support (being the first Mexican to do so). <s> Hidalgo remained in Dolores, waiting for Gutiérrez de Lara to return with military support. <s> However, fearing arrest, Hidalgo told his brother Mauricio to make the sheriff free the pro-independence inmates there. <s> Mauricio and armed men set 80 inmates free in the early morning of 16 September 1810. <s> Around 2:30 a.m., Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung and gathered his congregation. <s> Flanked by Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama, he addressed the people in front of his church, urging them to revolt. <s> His speech became known as the ""Cry of Dolores"". <s> The liberated country adopted Mexico as its official name. <s> Mexico's independence from Spain took a decade of war. <s> Gutiérrez de Lara commanded and led Mexico to victory. <s> Independence was achieved by the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire on 28 September 1821. <s> However, Hidalgo is credited as being the ""father of his country."" <s> There is no scholarly consensus on the exact words Miguel Hidalgo said at the time. <s> The book ""The Course of Mexican History"" says ""the exact words of this most famous of all Mexican speeches are not known, or, rather, they are reproduced in almost as many variations as there are historians to reproduce them"". <s> The Cry of Dolores has assumed an almost mythical status. <s> Since the late 20th century, the event has come to symbolize Mexican independence and to initiate Independence Day ceremonies the following day (16 September). <s> Independence Day in Mexico is a patriotic holiday, marked by parades, concerts, patriotic programs, drum and bugle and marching band competitions, and special programs on the national and local media outlets. <s> Every 15 September at around 11 p.m., the President of Mexico stands on the balcony of the National Palace in Mexico City and rings the same bell that Hidalgo rang in 1810, which was moved to the National Palace. <s> The President then recites a shout of patriotism (a Grito Mexicano) based upon the ""Grito de Dolores"", with the names of the important heroes of the Mexican War of Independence who were there on that historic day. <s> The Grito ends with the threefold shout of ""¡Viva México!"" <s> After the recitation, the President rings the bell one last time, and waves the Flag of Mexico to the applause of the crowd. <s> This is followed by the playing of the Mexican national anthem by a military band from the Mexican Armed Forces. <s> The crowd sings along. <s> The ceremonies conclude with a spectacular fireworks display at the Zocalo grounds. <s> On the morning of 16 September, or Independence Day, the national military parade in honor of the holiday starts in the Zócalo and its outskirts, passes the Hidalgo Memorial and ends on the Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City’s main boulevard, passing ""El Ángel de la Independencia"" memorial column and other places along the way. <s> President Felipe Calderón made an exception by re-enacting the Grito in Dolores Hidalgo as part of the bicentennial celebrations on 16 September 2010, even though he had already done so the night before from the National Palace balcony to launch the celebrations. <s> As a result, in 2012, Calderón's final year as President, he did not go to Dolores Hidalgo but gave the Grito from the National Palace balcony instead. <s> President Enrique Peña Nieto did not give the Grito in Dolores Hidalgo in any of his six years as President, becoming the fourth president to break the tradition. <s>

number of other men with guns go to the sheriff. <s> They set eighty free. <s> The next morning, at around 6:00 am, Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung. <s> With Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama by his side, he spoke to the people in front of his church. <s> Mexico's independence from Spain wouldn't be declared until September 27, 1821, after ten years of war. <s> This happened with the declaration of the first Mexican Empire. <s> Researchers do not agree as to what exactly Hidalgo said at the time. <s> September 16 is Independence Day in Mexico and is considered a patriotic holiday, or fiesta patria (literally, ""holiday of the Fatherland""). <s> This day is celebrated with parades, patriotic programs, drum and bugle and marching band competitions, and other special

boundaries stretch between the rivers Tyne and Tees, thus including places such as Gateshead, Jarrow, South Shields and Sunderland. <s> Many counties are named after their principal town, and the

Durham and is the only English county name prefixed with ""County"" in common usage (the practice is common in Ireland). <s> Its unusual naming (for an English shire) is explained to some extent by the relationship with the Bishops of Durham, who for centuries governed Durham as a county palatine (the County Palatine of Durham), outside the usual structure of county administration in England. <s> The ceremonial county of Durham is administered by four unitary authorities. <s> The ceremonial county has no administrative function, but remains the area to which the Lord Lieutenant of Durham and the High Sheriff of Durham are appointed. <s> The historic boundaries of County Durham included a main body covering the catchment of the Pennines in the west, the River Tees in the south, the North Sea in the east and the Rivers Tyne and Derwent in the north. <s> The county palatinate also had a number of liberties: the Bedlingtonshire, Islandshire and Norhamshire exclaves within Northumberland, and the Craikshire exclave within the North Riding of Yorkshire. <s> In 1831 the county covered an area of 679530 acre and had a population of 253,910. <s> These exclaves were included as part of the county for parliamentary electoral purposes until 1832, and for judicial and local-government purposes until the coming into force of the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, which merged most remaining exclaves with their surrounding county. <s> The boundaries of the county proper remained in use for administrative and ceremonial purposes until the 1972 Local Government Act. <s> The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 reformed the municipal boroughs of Durham, Stockton on Tees and Sunderland. <s> In 1875, Jarrow was incorporated as a municipal borough, as was West Hartlepool in 1887. <s> At a county level, the Local Government Act 1888 reorganised local government throughout England and Wales. <s> Most of the county came under control of the newly-formed Durham County Council in an area known as an administrative county. <s> Not included were the county boroughs of Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland. <s> However, for purposes other than local government, the administrative county of Durham and the county boroughs continued to form a single county to which the Crown appointed a Lord Lieutenant of Durham. <s> Over its existence, the administrative county lost territory, both to the existing county boroughs, and because two municipal boroughs became county boroughs: West Hartlepool in 1902 and Darlington in 1915. <s> The county boundary with the North Riding of Yorkshire was adjusted in 1967: that part of the town of Barnard Castle historically in Yorkshire was added to County Durham, while the administrative county ceded the portion of the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees in Durham to the North Riding. <s> In 1968, following the recommendation of the Local Government Commission, Billingham was transferred to the county borough of Teesside, in the

1972 which recovered the partial skeletal remains of more than 22 individuals. <s> The name of Kow Swamp is derived from an Aboriginal word in the Yorta Yorta language, ""(Ghow)"", which refers to the white gypsum soil found in the area. <s> Kow Swamp is now a permanent water body, due to its use for irrigation storage, 15 kilometres in circumference, with an average depth of 3 metres. <s> Originally a low lying swamp, it was filled when the Murray River is in flood or running at high levels, while Bendigo creek provides a smaller amount of water. <s> There is evidence of recent Aboriginal occupation of the area from canoe trees and middens, while early settlers' records describe an Aboriginal ceremonial site on the north side of the swamp. <s> The most notable evidence was the discovery in 1925, on the west side of the swamp, of the Cohuna Cranium by a local earthmoving contractor. <s> The editor of the local newspaper ""Cohuna Farmers Weekly"" notified authorities and the significance of the discovery was realised. <s> In the 1960s, Alan Thorne also identified archaic bone from the collection at the Museum of Victoria, and traced the find spot to Kow Swamp. <s>

resident, Gordon Spark. <s> By 1972 the remains of at least forty individuals had been excavated and studied. <s> These discoveries helped establish the diversity of Aboriginal genetic history and have been interpreted as representing different waves of immigrants to Australia before European discovery. <s> Radiocarbon dates returned a wide range of ages for the burials, with 13,000 ± 280

directly contradict the C14 dates, which were only ever minimum ages because of contamination by younger carbon. <s> The initial descriptions of the crania from Kow Swamp identified ""receding frontal

Prince of Orange,15679,"Prince of Orange (or Princess of Orange if the holder is female) is a title originally associated with the sovereign Principality of Orange, in what is now southern France. <s> Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, Frederick William I of Prussia ceded the Principality of Orange to King Louis XIV of France (while retaining the title as part of his dynastic titulature). <s> After William III of England died without children, a dispute arose between Johan Willem Friso and Frederick I of Prussia, which was settled in the Treaty of Partition (1732); consequently, Friso's son, William IV had to share use of the title ""Prince of Orange"" (which had accumulated prestige in the Netherlands and throughout the Protestant world) with Frederick William I of Prussia. <s> With the emergence of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the title is traditionally borne by the heir apparent of the Dutch monarch. <s> Originally only worn by men, since 1983 the title descends via absolute primogeniture, which means that the holder can be either Prince or Princess of Orange. <s> The Dutch royal dynasty, the House of Orange-Nassau, is not the only family to claim the dynastical title. <s> Rival claims to the title have been made by German emperors and kings of the House of Hohenzollern and by the head of the French noble family of Mailly. <s> The current users of the title are Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands (Orange-Nassau), Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia (Hohenzollern), and Guy, Marquis de Mailly-Nesle (Mailly). <s> The title originally referred to Orange in the Vaucluse department in the Rhone valley of southern France, which was a property of the House of Orange, then of the House of Baux and the House of Châlon-Arlay before passing in 1544 to the House of Orange-Nassau. <s> The last descendant of the original princes, René of Châlon, left the principality to his cousin William the Silent, who was not a descendant of the original Orange family but the heir to the principality of Orange by testament, however in violation against the inheritance pattern enacted by the last will of Marie des Baux, the Princess of Orange through kinship to whom Prince René derived his own right thereto. <s> In 1673, Louis XIV of France annexed all territory of the principality to France and to the royal domain, as part of the war actions against the stadtholder William III of Orange — who later became King William III of Great Britain. <s> Orange ceased to exist as a sovereign realm, de facto. <s> After the marquis (who died in 1713), the next holder was , marquis de Nesle (1689–1764). <s> Although no longer descended from Louis-Charles, a branch of the Mailly family still claim the title today. <s> In 1714 Louis XIV bestowed the usufruct of the principality on his kinsman, Louis Armand of Bourbon, Prince de Conti. <s> After his death in 1727 the principality was deemed merged in the Crown by 1731. <s> Because William III died without legitimate children, the principality was regarded as having been inherited by his closest cognate relative on the basis of the testament of Frederic-Henry, Frederick I of Prussia, who ceded the principality — at least the lands, but not the formal title — to France in 1713. <s> France supported his claim. <s> In this way, the territory of the principality lost its feudal and secular privileges and became a part of France. <s> The Treaty of Utrecht allowed the King of Prussia to erect part of the duchy of Gelderland (the cities of Geldern, Straelen and Wachtendonk with their

Orange"". <s> The kings of Prussia and the German emperors styled themselves Princes of Orange till 1918. <s> An agnatic relative of William III, John William Friso of Nassau, who was also cognatically descended from William the Silent, was designated the heir to the princes of Orange in the Netherlands by the last will of William III. <s> Several of his descendants became stadtholders. <s> They claim the principality of Orange on the basis of agnatic inheritance, similar to that of William the Silent, who had inherited Orange from his cousin René of Châlon. <s> They did however have a claim, albeit distant, to the principality itself due to John William Friso's descent from Louise de Coligny, who was a descendant of the original Princes of Orange. <s> (Louise's great grandmother, Anne Pot, Countess of St. Pol, was a descendant of Tiburge d'Orange, who married into the des Baux family) <s> They also claimed on the basis of the testament of Philip William, Maurice and William III. <s> Finally, they claimed on the basis that Orange was an independent state whose sovereign had the right to assign his succession according to his will. <s> France never recognized any of this, nor allowed the Orange-Nassaus or the Hohenzollerns to obtain anything of the principality itself. <s> The Oranje-Nassaus nevertheless assumed the title and also erected several of their lordships into a new principality of Orange. <s> From that derivation of the title comes the tradition of the house of Nassau-Dietz, the later stadtholders of the Netherlands, and the present-day royal family of the Netherlands, of holding this title. <s> They maintain the tradition of William the Silent and the house of Orange-Nassau. <s> Until 1340, it was customary for all sons of the
