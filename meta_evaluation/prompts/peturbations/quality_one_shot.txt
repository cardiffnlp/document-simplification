One example of a paragraph and its high quality human written simplification that should be rated as 5 are mentioned below:

Source paragraph: Brazil’s latest funk sensation, Anitta, has won millions of fans by taking the favela sound into the mainstream, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour. Anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industry’s fastest rising star has had to sacrifice her blackness to make it into the predominantly white middle- class market. The controversy was prompted by the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of Anitta’s skin tone since she signed a deal with Warner. 

Simplification: Anitta, a music star from Brazil, has millions of fans, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour. 
Some people are saying that Anitta had to give up her black skin to be a success in the mostly white middle-class market. The debate was started by photographs that show that Anitta’s skin has got much lighter since she signed a music deal with Warner.
