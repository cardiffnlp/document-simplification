One example of a paragraph and its high quality human written simplification that should rated as 5 are mentioned below:

Source paragraph: Brazil’s latest funk sensation, Anitta, has won millions of fans by taking the favela sound into the mainstream, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour. Anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industry’s fastest rising star has had to sacrifice her blackness to make it into the predominantly white middle- class market. The controversy was prompted by the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of Anitta’s skin tone since she signed a deal with Warner. 

Simplification: Anitta, a music star from Brazil, has millions of fans, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour. 
Some people are saying that Anitta had to give up her black skin to be a success in the mostly white middle-class market. The debate was started by photographs that show that Anitta’s skin has got much lighter since she signed a music deal with Warner.

Evaluation Criteria for Meaning Preservation:

Accuracy: How well does the simplified version maintain the original meaning and content of the paragraph?
Completeness: Does the simplified version cover all the main points and essential information from the original paragraph?
Fidelity: How faithful is the simplified version to the tone, style, and intent of the original paragraph?
Clarity: Is the simplified version clear and easy to understand, without introducing ambiguity or confusion?
Omissions: Are any important details or context omitted from the simplified version that alter its meaning or impact?

Rating Scale:

1: Very Poor (significant meaning lost or distorted)
2: Poor (some meaning preserved, but with notable omissions or distortions)
3: Fair (most meaning preserved, with minor omissions or distortions)
4: Good (meaning well-preserved, with high fidelity and clarity)
5: Excellent (meaning perfectly preserved, with no omissions or distortions)
