'mars-glass.en-0-0-2': 'Kevin Cannon and John Mustard, of Brown University, reported the glass discovery on June 5 in Geology.', 'mars-glass.en-0-1-0': "When an asteroid or comet pummels a planet's

the atoms have time to organize themselves into a neat crystal lattice.', 'mars-glass.en-0-1-2': 'Unlike the see-through glass we encounter in daily life, this material is dark brown, almost black, and only partly transparent.', 'mars-glass.en-0-1-3': 'It may look like freshly cooled lava from a place like Hawaii, says Cannon, a Ph.D. student and the lead author, even though the two materials form through different processes.', 'mars-glass.en-0-2-0': 'Because asteroids and comets routinely slam into planets throughout the solar system — in fact, collisions are the only geologic processes that affect all rocky and icy bodies in the solar system — scientists have long suspected that impact glass exists on other planets.', 'mars-glass.en-0-2-1': 'The new study lends observational support to the idea.', 'mars-glass.en-0-3-0': '## Glimpsing The Glass', 'mars-glass.en-0-4-0': 'Until now, impact glass on Mars has proved to be elusive because it gives off only weak spectral signal.', 'mars-glass.en-0-4-1': 'Scientists identify different types of rocks on the Martian surface by picking out the unique spectral "fingerprints" these materials leave in sunlight reflected off the planet.', 'mars-glass.en-0-4-2': 'Opaque materials absorb lots of sunlight, so their spectral signatures in reflected light are stronger than the signatures of partially translucent materials like impact glass, explains Briony Horgan, a planetary scientist at Purdue University who was not part of this study.', 'mars-glass.en-0-4-3': 'Consequently, signals from any rocks that might be mixed in with the impact glass easily overwhelm signals from the glass itself.', 'mars-glass.en-0-5-0': 'Cannon overcame this obstacle by fabricating his own artificial Martian impact glass.', 'mars-glass.en-0-5-1': 'He mixed together powders to create a concoction with similar composition to rocks on the Red Planet, basing his recipe on data from Mars rover samples and studies of Martian meteorites.', 'mars-glass.en-0-5-2': 'He then melted his mixture in an oven and allowed it to harden into faux impact glass.', 'mars-glass.en-0-6-0': 'By measuring the spectral signal of this imitation impact glass, Cannon, along with Mustard, a professor of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown, knew precisely what to look for on the Martian surface.', 'mars-glass.en-0-6-1': "Mustard used an algorithm to scour data collected by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's imaging spectrometer in hopes of finding similar signals.", 'mars-glass.en-0-7-0': 'Their search turned up a slew of previously undetected glass deposits in craters across the Martian surface.', 'mars-glass.en-0-7-1': 'The positions of these deposits inside the craters — on central peaks that form when an asteroid or comet strikes the planet — demonstrates that the glass was indeed formed during the impacts.', 'mars-glass.en-0-7-2': '"It wasn\'t completely surprising," Cannon says,

ancient environments, like time capsules."', 'mars-glass.en-0-11-6': "Howard says he is cautiously excited about Cannon and Mustard's discovery.", 'mars-glass.en-0-12-0': 'Impact glass is not only good for giving a snapshot of life in the blasting zone at the time of the impact; the glass itself can host microbial life that moves in after the dust has settled.', 'mars-glass.en-0-13-0': 'A group of organisms called chemolithoautotrophs can tunnel into the glass and live off its nutrients.', 'mars-glass.en-0-13-1': '"These guys were thought to be some of the earliest types of life on Earth,

world with oodles of different storms.', 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-4-0': '"When you do hundreds and hundreds of thousands of events, you\'re going to see hurricanes that are unlike anything you\'ve

Category 3 hurricane following a similar track to Tampa's classic 1921 and 1848 storms.", 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-9-1': "Moreover, in a late 21st-century climate with global warming run amok, the worst-case scenario generated by the model included a very different storm track, moving north along Florida's Gulf Coast and then swerving inland at Tampa, that generated an 11.1-meter (nearly 37-foot) surge.", 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-10-0': 'Granted, the study said that these two "gray swans" are exceedingly unlikely — less than 1 in 10,000 years for the 5.9-meter surge in the current climate.', 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-10-1': 'But it also said that global warming shifts the odds toward the worse surges.', 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-11-0': '"The more publicity of the hurricane risk in Tampa, the better," Emanuel said.', 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-12-0': 'The study also shows that for Cairns, Australia, a 5.7-meter (18-foot) storm surge is possible in the current climate, but that

never yet seen them occur: the Persian Gulf.", 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-13-0': 'The waters in the Persian Gulf are very hot and so contain considerable potential hurricane energy, but the atmosphere is normally too dry for hurricanes, Emanuel explained.', 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-13-1': 'Nonetheless, "physics says that you can have one," he said.', 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-13-2': '"It\'s not likely, but it\'s not impossible."', 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-14-0': 'Indeed, there have been several hurricanes or tropical storms that have entered the Arabian Sea, though none have made it into the

'hypercane-forecast.en-0-15-0': "Indeed, it found that with 3,100 simulated events in today's climate, it is theoretically possible to get a hurricane with winds of over 250 mph — stronger than anything we've seen on Earth — and a storm surge of 7.4 meters (24 feet) affecting Dubai.", 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-15-1': 'Granted, it is hard to emphasize enough that this is a rare phenomenon — storms like this have "return periods of the order of 30,000-200,000 years," the study said.', 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-16-0': 'So, is all of this just a mathematical exercise — or something more?', 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-16-1': "In the end, it's kind of in the eye of the beholder, as it's up to us to decide how much to worry, if at all, about an extraordinarily rare event.", 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-16-2': 'But you could make the case that a study like this helps us think a lot better about what risk is all about.', 'hypercane-forecast.en-0-17-0': '"You go out on the
